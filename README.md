# DOTFILES

This repository contains the configuration files for some of the programs I use. 
Most of the configurations are copied from ThePrimeagen. Check out his dotfiles at [ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles)

## Installation

To install the configuration files I recommend using [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)
